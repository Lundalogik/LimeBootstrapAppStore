#  Follow Up #
This app will help you keep track of how you and the company are doing to reach your monthly goals for the different activity types.

###How it works
You can see current value, total month goal and month to date goal.

Read the Followup_sales.docx in the instructions folder for more detailed info

The tile are represented in tree colors, red, yellow and green. You set the percentage representing the colors by specifying the limit for the yellow color. 

Example: yellow on 75% will end up in 

* 0% - 74% - Red
* 75% - 99% - Yellow
* 100% + - Green

**The tagets**

In the Target table each coworker gets a goal per activity and month. Only coworkers with goals will be calculated.

###Misc
It shows all strings in local language.

###How to set it up
Users need to have acceess to the target table.
