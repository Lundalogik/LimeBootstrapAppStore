# Lime CRM InfoTiles
## Serving you the numbers you care about
Lime CRM InfoTiles brings you your personalized daily information needs served at your fingertips. This addictive app not only saves you time but also keeps you up-to-date with the information you desire. 
## Description
Lime CRM InfoTiles presents the result from filters that you setup in Lime CRM. A filter could for instance be “history notes made on my customers by anyone else but myself during last day” and present a “# new history notes” on your actionpad. 
Each item can use individual color settings making it easy to identify urgency.
When you click on the text, Lime CRM will bring you to the correct table with the appropriate filter.
As you set your filters yourself, only you, Lime CRM and the sky is the limit.
