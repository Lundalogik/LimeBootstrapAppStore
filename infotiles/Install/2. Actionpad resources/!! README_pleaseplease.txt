=========== Good to know =============

Instructions for newbies:

1. Insert supplied code snippets to your *.html-files you want to use the InfoTiles-app. for example: index.html, company.html and so on. in the "Actionpads" folder.
2. Copy the supplied Actionpads folder and paste it onto (not within) your existing Actionpads folder. Since no files will be overwritten (assuming you don't have any InfoTiles files i don't know of), you can safely choose the option of "Overwrite existing files to target" when the dialog pops.
