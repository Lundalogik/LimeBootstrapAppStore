#Creditinfo

##Info

A bad rating is displayed as red, a medium rating as yellow and a good rating as green. The rating fades with time and disappears after a certain age (default 365 days). You can use the app either in the actionpad or in a HTML-field. If you use it in a field, set the config-parameter inline=true

##Install

*	registrationno - text field - Contains the registration number, exisits as default in LIME Basics
* 	creditinfo - XML field - Stores the data
 
Add the following HTML to the ActionPad (BusinessCheck-example):

```html
<div data-app="{app:'creditinfo', config:{
	businessCheck:{
customerLoginName : 'string',
		    	userLoginName: 'string',
            		password : 'string',
            		packageName : 'string'
	}
}}">

###BusinessCheck-setup
BusinessCheck requires you to create a package for the customer and allow webservice access. The package should ONLY contain “ratingvalue” and “ratingtext”. Call Bisnode Kredit and they will help you. 

Many customers have unique users and passwords for every LIME-user. In that case you’ll need to implement a function which fetches this information from the users coworker card. An example:

```html
<div data-app="{app:'creditinfo', config:{
	businessCheck:{
customerLoginName : 'CustomerX',
		    	userLoginName: lbs.common.executeVBA('Your VBA-function here'),
            		password : lbs.common.executeVBA('Your VBA-function here'),
            		packageName : 'CustomerXRatingPackage'
	}
}}">
</div>
```
###Creditsafe-setup
Creditsafe requires you to create a package for the customer and allow webservice access. The package should be a credit template for company. Call creditsafe and they will help you.
